# Python-Algorithmic-Trading-Library


### Python Library For Algorithmic Trading Indicators



## Algorithmic Trading Indicators Goals:

1.  Attempting to solve all indicators in the most efficient way possible using python with the help of computing libraries
    such as numpy, scipy and many more. 
    
2. To create simple solutions for complex indicators and advanced mathematical functions that allow for a more 
   widespread use of advanced trading techniques


## How To Structure Indicators Within The Main Body Of Trading Systems Real Time Processing Engine

1. The indicators in this library show how to solve for signals using technical analysis, but in no way
   should these indicators be used to trade live with real money and risk at stake. These indicators are simple
   and basic, to actually solve for signals to trade live intraday, would require much more complex methods.
   
   **If interested in learning more about how to derive signals from the market:
         
         Khan Academy offers courses in areas such as linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and also in quantitative 
         statistics and how to interpret them. These are very important concepts to understand before moving forward. 
         For optimizing signals, learning about stochastic processes and the using of different forms of these processes 
         such as the Ornstein Uhlenbeck to backsolve to find the most optimized form of the signal
         
          
 


1. Using numpy and pandas import modules for handling all computations increases runtime speed dramatically
